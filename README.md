# Reference-Connector-Template
This is a template for a wrapper that will allow third-party connectors
to provide data on the DOME 4.0 platform.

The template has been created using [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter). 

## Generate your project from the template
First, install cookiecutter according to [the documentation](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).

Then run the following command to generate your project:
```
cookiecutter gh:DOME-4-0/reference-connector
```

Now type in the required inputs to customize your repository.

Alternatively, you can pre-define the inputs in a JSON file and pass it to the cookiecutter command using the --config-file option. The list of input keys and default values can be found in cookiecutter.json.
An overview is also provided in the following table:
